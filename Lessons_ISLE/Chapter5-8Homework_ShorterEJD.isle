**The purpose of this exercise is to help you learn that manipulating data in different ways creates different data stories.**

Imagine we have conducted a study of students in a class, recording the number of pens and pencils they are carrying on four different dates (*yes, this is a silly study*). Using this data, please do the following:

* Create two different visualizations to illustrate three different stories you might tell about this data.
* Then, choose one of these visualizations and write up approximately 1-4 sentences describing its main and (if relevant) secondary stories.

A helpful note: your audience is fellow students and instructors who want to learn more about studentsâ€™ habits and practices. 

You can create data plots, of course. You can also create data tables via the statistics tab. Just be sure that the data visualizations you create tell a clear story.  Be sure that each of your visualizations has a complete caption and that axes are labeled. Follow the design principles from Chapter 4, and be prepared to defend your design choices in class.

**The purpose of this exercise is to give you practice with putting your data stories in writing.**

### 8.1 -- PART I: Using wordchoice to express confidence

It is important to distinguish between **factual statements *about* the data** and **more debatable conclusions that we draw *from* the data**. The paragraphs in your results section should usually move from factual statements to less factual (though reasonable) conclusions about the data. Your verb choices should change to reflect your confidence in the data.

Remember this OKCupd graph on Twitter users and relationship lengths from Chapter 2? 

<div align="center">
<Image src="https://isle.stat.cmu.edu/WAD-proseed_Twitter_plot.png"  width="500" height="500" /></div>

Each of the 5 pages below contains a statement about this OKCupd data plot. For each statement, select the verb that you think best completes the sentence, making sure that the verb expresses a level of confident you think is appropriate for the statement. You can also indicate that you think the statement is just too far-fetched to be reasonable, even with a tentative verb.

### 8.1 -- PART II: Writing a data story in paragraphs

The fog warning paragraph below also appears in Chapter 8, on page 3.

<div align="center">
<Image src="https://isle.stat.cmu.edu/WAD-proseed_Fog-Warning-System.png"  width="600" height="220" /></div>

Using this fog warning paragraph as a model, write a paragraph interpreting the OKCupid Twitter users plot from Part I. Skip the sentence with the significance test, but be sure to (1) state the main story of the OKCupid Twitter plot, (2) support it with data; (3) state the secondary story and support it with data, and (4) suggest reasons for the finding. If there is a clearly logical conclusion to draw from this data, state it in this paragraph.

**The purpose of this exercise is to prepare you to weave data stories in order to write a full results section.**

### 8.2 -- Analyzing a Results Section

Revist the excerpt of "Improving Instructor Ethos Through Document Design" on page 10 of Chapter 8. You should read this excerpt carefully and be very familiar with it, as it will prove very useful for you as you work toward writing your own results section. 

Below is the first half of this excerpt, with each sentence numbered:

<Image src="https://isle.stat.cmu.edu/WAD-proseed_Instructor-Ethos-Doc-Design-Excerpt.png" alt="E"
  height={800}  width={800}
/>




Review the excerpt above and then answer each of the 7 questions below, indicating what each numbered sentence is doing in the excerpt.
