***************************************


#### Exercise 3.1

*The purpose of this exercise is to refine your caption-writing skills.* 

On each of the 6 pages below, analyze the caption and determine whether it is adequate as it stands or if it needs more information. If it needs more information, specify how the caption should be revised.

#### Exercise 3.3

**The purpose of this exercise is to give you practice in creating strong data visualizations.**

For each of the four datasets, create a data visualization that tells a compelling story. You may choose to represent the data with a graph or leave it in a table, but be sure to design your visualization to emphasize the story you want to tell. 

Your visualizations should include 
* Clearly labeled axes 
* Readable and easily understandable legends
* Captions that contain 
    - The word “figure” or “table” followed by a number and a colon 
    - Clearly explained units of measurement
    - What is being compared 
    - Any other necessary context 

Be prepared to describe and defend your design choices in class discussion.

### Dataset 2: This data was collected to answer the question of how much energy is used (measured in average kilowatts per hour) in two equivalent buildings in different parts of the United States. <DataExplorer
  data={dataset2}
  categorical={[]}
  quantitative={[]}
/><FreeTextQuestion
  question="Enter your caption for the visualization above"
