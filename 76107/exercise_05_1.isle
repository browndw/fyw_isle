# Exercise 5.1
# Putting your data story into words

For homework, you were asked to create visualizions, caption them, and then write short interpreations of those visualions.

To carrry out the exercise, you were provided some toy data about pencils, which appears in the **Data Explorer** below.

With a partner, compare your responses. Decide on a visualization and accompanying story that you think is particularly explanatory and/or compelling.

Using the **Data Explorer**, recreate a version of the visualization. Note that you'll mostly restricted to bar plots and tables. (Remember that you can use '**Bars represent**' and select '**Function evaluated for variable**'.) Line plots don't have as much functionality.

Once you've created your visualization. Go to the 'Report' view. Drag over your visualization. Caption it. And compose an interpretation. You can draw from your homework, of course.
